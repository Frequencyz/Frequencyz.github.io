 Ruby is a pure object oriented language, and everything appears to Ruby as an object. Objects represent real world objects, and share two main characteristics (Data & Behavior). Data is to attributes as behavior is to methods.  You could write any Ruby program without Object Oriented Programming, but using Object Oriented Programming makes things easier because Object Oriented Programming is all about how you design & organize your code. Classes that represent concepts in your program. A class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created, and objects are useful because we can manipulate them as we need. When you create a new object it comes with some data. You are instantiating a new object from a specific class. In our real world we deal with lots of objects. Itâ€™s hard to abstract it to code, at least for me anyway.
