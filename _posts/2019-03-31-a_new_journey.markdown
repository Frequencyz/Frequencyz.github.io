   I've been working in the manufacturing industry for the last 20 years. Blue collar manual labor type stuff, which i don't really mind getting my hands dirty. I have honestly always tolerated that type of work, but health issues and concerns have forced me to begin a new career. So my wife and myself had a conversation about what I could do as a career that I actually enjoyed. I've always heard the phrase "If you love what you do, you never work a day in your life." So I thought back to my younger days messing around with my friends on the Commodore 64 writing code to make our own really bad games, but I loved doing that. 

   Fast forward to my senior year of high school, in which they made everyone take a computer class. Computers were the wave of the future, and the world wide web was in it's infancy. That was probably the easiest grade I ever earned, since I had been messing around with computers pretty much my entire life up until that point. I vividly remember the final project. It was just to make a stop light appear on the screen, and change from green to yellow to red. I didn't even think about it, and was done in what seemed liked no time to me. I even made a four way intersection with cars, and other varios things. My teacher pulled me aside at the end of the year and said you should seriously consider doing this as a career. Of course being a teenager I laughed it off because I wanted to do my own thing. So now I start this new journey with all of you.
